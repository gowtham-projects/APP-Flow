S3 Data Transformation Flow Project

Architecture:

[Source S3 Bucket] → [AppFlow Transformation] → [Destination S3 Bucket]

Step-by-Step Implementation:

Step 1️⃣: Create S3 Buckets

We’ll need two buckets:
Source bucket (stores raw files)
Destination bucket (stores transformed files)

Steps:
Go to AWS S3 Console → Create bucket.
Name: appflow-source-bucket-yourname
Region: Your preferred region (e.g., us-east-1)
Keep defaults, uncheck "Block all public access" (but keep it private)
Click Create bucket

Repeat for Destination bucket: appflow-dest-bucket-yourname

Step 2️⃣: Upload a Sample CSV to Source Bucket
Create a folder and upload a simple file, employees.csv, on PC:

id,name,department
1,Alice,IT
2,Bob,HR
3,Charlie,Finance
Upload it to your source bucket.

Step 3️⃣: Create an IAM Role for AppFlow
AppFlow needs permission to read from source S3 and write to destination S3.

Steps:
Go to IAM → Roles → Create role
Select AppFlow as the AWS service
Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy (or a least-privilege custom policy)
Name it: AppFlowS3Role and create the role

Step 4️⃣: Create the AppFlow Flow
Steps:

Go to AWS AppFlow Console → Create flow
Name: S3DataTransferFlow
Source name: Amazon S3
Choose your source bucket → Select employees.csv, provide foldername/ as prefix

Destination name: Amazon S3
Choose your destination bucket
Select IAM role: AppFlowS3Role
(Optional) Add a mapping: e.g., rename name to employee_name

After creating the AppFlow.Click Run flow.

Step 5️⃣: Verify Output
Go to your destination bucket and check if a new CSV file exists with the transformed field names.

=> We can use you to specify which amount of data to add in the destination using some specifications in AppFlow and use Lambda Function code.
